abstract = {Spatial and temporal cues are required to specify neuronal diversity, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors remains unknown. \textit{Drosophila} progenitors (neuroblasts) are a good model: they are individually identifiable with relevant spatial and temporal transcription factors known. Here we test whether spatial/temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. We used Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that make different progeny. Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Importantly, the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. Our data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.},

abstract = {The nervous system consists of a vast diversity of neurons and glia that are accurately assembled into functional circuits. What are the mechanisms that generate these diverse cell types? During development, an epithelial sheet with neurogenic potential is initially regionalised into spatially restricted domains of gene expression. From this, pools of neural stem cells (NSCs) with distinct molecular profiles and the potential to generate different neuron types, are specified. These NSCs then divide asymmetrically to self-renew and generate post-mitotic neurons or glia. As NSCs age, they experience transitions in gene expression, which further allows them to generate different neurons or glia over time. Versions of this general template of spatial and temporal patterning operate during the development of different parts of different nervous systems. Here, I cover our current knowledge of Drosophila brain and optic lobe development as well as the development of the vertebrate cortex and spinal cord within the framework of this above template. I highlight where our knowledge is lacking, where mechanisms beyond these might operate, and how the emergence of new technologies might help address unanswered questions.}

abstract = {In the animal kingdom, sexual dimorphism often creates marked differences between males and females. These can be so pronounced that individuals of the same species may even appear unrelated. Such dimorphism also extends to behaviours. Males often perform elaborate courtship rituals to attract females, while females usually invest in offspring care. Among insects too, sexual dimorphism in form and behaviour is readily observed. Here, we discuss sexual dimorphism in mosquitoes, whose males and females exhibit distinct anatomical, physiological, and behavioural differences. We focus on two behaviours: female-specific blood-feeding and male-specific courtship and mating. These behaviours rely on distinct sensory modalities resulting in sexual dimorphism within their sensory organs, neural circuits, and molecular genetics. We explore these differences in the context of olfaction, gustation, and audition in mosquitoes.}
