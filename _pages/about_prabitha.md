I am an insect behavioural ecologist. I did my PhD at the Central University of Kerala, where I studied how parasitic wasps manipulate the behaviour of their hosts. I then worked at the Zoological Survey of India on the Long Term Ecological Observatories (LTEO) project, studying the effects of climate change on arthropods in India's eco-sensitive zones. I later moved to the Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) on the National Postdoctoral Fellowship to study how competition influences the foraging behaviour of female parasite wasps. Here at TIGS, my research focuses on the chemical ecology of plant-feeding behaviour of mosquitoes. Outside of research, I enjoy reading comics, exploring food, and spending time with family and friends.
