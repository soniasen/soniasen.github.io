I’m a final-year biotechnology student at VIT, Vellore. Curiosity led me to explore computational approaches for categorizing mosquito larvae at TIGS. Before that, I worked with iGEM VIT on synthesizing ambergris (a.k.a. sperm whale vomit) using *Escherichia coli*. Outside the lab, I enjoy running, playing guitar, and finding hills to climb, usually posing awkwardly at the top.
