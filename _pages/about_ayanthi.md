I study how neural precursor cells in *Drosophila* know which neurons to make—how they “read” positional and temporal cues to produce the right neuronal types. I am interested in developmental biology, behaviour, and evo-devo. Outside the lab, I like to sing, draw, design, and write a little. Also, I sincerely believe in the unifying power of Bollywood dance moves, and I sometimes practise said moves with my cats, Mitthu and Kiki.
