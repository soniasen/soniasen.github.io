The behavioral repertoire of animals is exquisite and complex. This is made possible by the nervous system, which is equally complex. In most, very many different types of neurons and glia make precise and specific connections with each other. We study how this complexity is assembled during development, how it gives right to behaviour, and how it might have evolved.
