The behavioral repertoire of animals is exquisite and complex. This is made possible by the nervous system, which is equally complex. In most brains, very many different types of neurons and glia make extremely precise and specific connections with each other. This precision is critical for the survival and functioning of animals. We study how this complexity is accurately and reproducibly assembled during development, how it gives right to behaviour, and how it might have evolved.
