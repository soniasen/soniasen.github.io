
I was drawn to neurobiology because of a talk by Veronica Rodrigues. She was presenting her work on the development of the fly olfactory circuit and I was captivated by the idea that one could observe and investigate such complex cellular processes during development.

I have since used Drosophila as a model to understand how diverse neurons of the brain are generated and assembled into circuits during development. More recently, I have become interested in how such circuits in the brain give rise to complex behaviours such blood feeding in female mosquitoes.
