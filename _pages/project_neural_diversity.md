Across animals, developing nervous systems produce a remarkable range of neural cell types. This diversity arises from stem cells that interpret and integrate positional information, developmental time, and local signals to generate distinct cell identities. How these different layers of information are integrated within progenitors, and how they shape the assembly of functional circuits, remains a central question in neurobiology.

We study this process across multiple systems, asking how spatial cues, temporal programs, and chromatin landscapes interact to produce specific neuronal outcomes. Depending on the organism or context, we pair genetic and developmental approaches with single-cell and epigenomic methods to map lineage decisions and the regulatory logic that drives them.
