During development, neural stem cells (NSCs) generate diverse neurons that make up circuitry in the brain. Lineally related neurons – born from the same NSC - integrate into functionally related circuitry such as olfaction. In the insect brain, therefore, developmental units – lineages – lay down the functional ground plan of the brain. This presents us with a powerful yet accessible opportunity to understand how circuitry develops and generates behaviour at a brain-wide scale.
 
So, we approach brain circuitry with lineages – not individual neurons – as the minimal developmental and functional units of the brain. We ask 1) how NSC identity is specified and maintained during development, and 2) how these circuits give rise to behaviour.

#####NSC Identity#####

NSCs are specified by regionally expressed embryonic patterning genes expressed in the neuroectoderm. Each NSC experiences unique combinations of these ‘spatial transcription factors’ (sTF). This imparts unique identities to each NSC lineage. Importantly, NSCs are only transiently in contact with the neuroectoderm, raising the question: How is NSC identity maintained? This could be via sTF "codes" that last the life of the NSC, or via heritable changes in the chromatin landscape, or both.

#####Blood feeding behaviour#####

To understand how neural circuits control behaviour, we turn to a different the mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, an Indian malarial vector that is rapidly expanding its range into Africa. Like many other mosquitoes it usually feeds on nectar or sap, but occasionally the female switches to taking blood meals. This change in dietary preference lies at the heart of disease transmission. So, we want to understand how central brain circuitry responds to environmental cues ri  drive this change in dietary preference.
