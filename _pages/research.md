During development, neural stem cells (NSCs) generate diverse neurons that make up circuitry in the brain. Lineally related neurons – born from the same NSC - integrate into functionally related circuitry such as olfaction. In the insect brain, therefore, developmental units – lineages – lay down the functional ground plan of the brain. This presents us with a powerful yet accessible opportunity to understand how circuitry develops and generates behaviour at a brain-wide scale.
 
So, we approach brain circuitry with lineages – not individual neurons – as the minimal developmental and functional units of the brain. We ask 1) how NSC identity is specified and maintained during development, and 2) how these circuits give rise to behaviou
