Animals constantly adjust what they eat and when, balancing external cues with their internal needs. Mosquitoes offer a striking example of this behavioural plasticity. Both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectar or sap, but the females also take blood-meals for egg development. Their feeding decision - sap or blood meal - depends on their physiological state, reproductive timing, and the environmental context. We study how these shifting internal states are represented at the molecular and circuit levels. Using a combination of behavioural approaches and modern genomic and imaging tools, we aim to reveal how internal state reshapes sensory processing and decision-making in the mosquito brain.
