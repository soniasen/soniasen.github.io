Mosquito larvae move in surprisingly characteristic ways, shaped by their morphology, sensory world, and the aquatic environments they inhabit. Their swimming involves coordinated bouts, pauses, and turns, and these patterns differ across groups in ways that reflect both ecology and evolution. We study these movement signatures by tracking how larvae accelerate, reorient, and explore their surroundings in response to cues. Work of this kind can also form the foundation for developing simple, accessible tools that use movement patterns to distinguish larvae in the field.
