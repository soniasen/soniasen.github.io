We’re always excited to welcome new minds into our team! Our lab brings together people who are curious about how insects develop, behave, and interact with their environments. We explore these questions through a mix of neurobiology, ecology, and cutting-edge single-cell omics approaches. We value curiosity, creativity, and collaboration in everything we do!

### How to Join
If our work sparks your interest, reach out to sonia.sen@tigs.res.in with your CV and a short note about your background and what excites you about joining the lab. We welcome inquiries from motivated undergraduate students, project trainees, and postdoctoral fellows interested in our work. Even if there isn’t a formal opening listed, feel free to write to us — we’re always keen to connect with passionate scientists!

### Graduate Students (PhD Program)
At the moment, we accept graduate students through the PhD program hosted at TIGS, in collaboration with the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR). Details and announcements can be found [here](https://tigs.res.in/impact/phd-program/)
