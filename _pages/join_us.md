We’re always excited to welcome new minds into our team! Our lab brings together people who are curious about how mosquitoes develop, behave, and interact with their environments. We explore these questions through a mix of neurobiology, ecology, and cutting-edge single-cell omics approaches.

Whether you’re a student discovering research for the first time or a postdoctoral fellow looking to expand your scientific horizons, we’d love to hear from you. We value curiosity, creativity, and collaboration in everything we do.

If our work sparks your interest, reach out to sonia.sen@tigs.res.in with your CV and a short note about your background and what excites you about joining the lab.
