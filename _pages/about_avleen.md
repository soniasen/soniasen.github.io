I graduated from IISER Mohali with an integrated BS–MS in Biological Sciences. My research interests lie at the intersection of animal behaviour, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience, with a focus on how animals behave across different ecological contexts and how neural circuits has evolved to generate and modulate these behaviours. I am particularly interested in understanding behaviour as an emergent product of physiological state, neural circuitry and ecological context. Outside the lab, I enjoy PC gaming, binge watching, and bird watching during nature walks, and a big fan of dogs and cats.
