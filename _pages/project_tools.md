Many of the systems we work in require approaches that either don’t yet exist, are too expensive, or aren’t easily accessible. We adapt and develop methods for visualising, measuring, and manipulating gene expression across species. These “home-brew” tools allow us to ask mechanistic questions in emerging models and to scale up exploratory work where standard reagent pipelines fall short.
