I completed my PhD in Biochemistry at the Max Planck Institute for Biology, Tübingen, Germany, and briefly worked at the University of Exeter, UK, before joining TIGS in 2020. Here, I am interested in uncovering the neurobiology of blood-feeding behaviour in *Anopheles stephensi* mosquitoes. Outside the lab, I’m usually off travelling and soaking in the local culture and food wherever I go.
